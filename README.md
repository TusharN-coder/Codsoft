🚀 CodSoft Java Programming Internship | Project Repository
Welcome to my CodSoft Java Programming Internship repository! 🎯 During this internship, I had the incredible opportunity to enhance my Java skills by working on multiple hands-on projects, focusing on problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and algorithm development.

🔥 About the Internship
The CodSoft Internship Program provided a structured learning experience, allowing me to apply Java programming concepts in real-world scenarios. I worked on various tasks that helped improve my logical thinking, coding efficiency, and debugging skills. Each project in this repository demonstrates my approach to tackling programming challenges with clean, efficient, and well-structured code.

📌 Tasks I Completed
Throughout the internship, I successfully built the following projects:

🕹️ Task 1: Number Guessing Game
🔹 Developed an interactive game where the system generates a random number, and the user keeps guessing until they find the correct one.
🔹 Features like limited attempts, multiple rounds, and score tracking were implemented to make the game engaging.
🔹 Concepts used: Loops, Conditional Statements, Random Number Generation

📊 Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
🔹 Designed a Java program that takes marks from multiple subjects, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the student’s performance.
🔹 Included input validation to ensure marks fall within the valid range (0-100).
🔹 Concepts used: Arrays, Loops, Conditional Statements, Mathematical Operations

🏧 Task 3: ATM Interface
🔹 Built a console-based ATM system that allows users to Deposit, Withdraw, and Check Balance.
🔹 Implemented object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by creating an interface for ATM operations and a class for bank accounts.
🔹 Added input validation to ensure transactions follow proper rules, such as insufficient balance checks.
🔹 Concepts used: OOP (Interfaces, Classes, Methods), Conditional Statements, User Input Handling

🎯 Key Learnings
✔ Strengthened my problem-solving skills by breaking down complex problems into simple, manageable parts.
✔ Gained hands-on experience in Java, covering topics like OOP, input validation, loops, and conditionals.
✔ Improved my ability to write clean, readable, and optimized code.
✔ Understood the importance of user-friendly interactions and validation in software development.
